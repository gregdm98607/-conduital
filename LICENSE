4. DATA HANDLING AND PRIVACY

  (a) LOCAL DATA STORAGE. All user data (projects, tasks, settings,

      user data directory (typically %LOCALAPPDATA%\Conduital\). The
      Software does not transmit your project data, tasks, or personal
      information to the Licensor or any third party.

      reads and writes markdown files in a folder you specify on your
      local filesystem or cloud-synced drive. The Licensor has no
      access to these files.

  (c) AI FEATURES — THIRD-PARTY API. The Software optionally integrates
      with the Anthropic Claude API for AI-powered features. When you
      enable AI features:

      - You provide your own Anthropic API key.
      - Data you submit to AI features (project descriptions, task
        content, etc.) is sent directly from your Device to Anthropic's
        servers under YOUR API key and YOUR Anthropic account.
      - The Licensor does not receive, store, process, or have access
        to any data sent to Anthropic.
      - Your use of the Anthropic API is governed by Anthropic's own
        Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (https://www.anthropic.com).
      - All API usage costs are between you and Anthropic. The Licensor
        is not responsible for any charges incurred through your use of
        the Anthropic API.

  (d) LICENSE VALIDATION. If license key validation is implemented in
      a future version, the Software may transmit your license key to
      the Gumroad API (https://gumroad.com) to verify your purchase.
      No other data is transmitted during this process.

  (e) NO TELEMETRY. The Software does not collect analytics, usage
      telemetry, crash reports, or any other data about your usage.
