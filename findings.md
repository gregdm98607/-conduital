# Findings: 0.6 Product Naming & Branding

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Context:** Section 0.6 of distribution checklist — product naming research

---

## 1. User's Prior Research (ChatGPT Session)

The user already went through extensive naming exploration with ChatGPT. Key decisions:

### Brand Identity
- **Target:** Intelligent independent operators / solopreneurs
- **Feeling:** "Quiet Intelligence"
- **Philosophy:** "A disciplined operating axis that naturally produces momentum"
- **Not selling:** Speed, AI, or task management
- **Selling:** A disciplined operating philosophy

### Eliminated Names (with reasons)
| Name | Risk | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| Momentus | Very High | Momentus Technologies exists (venue/event mgmt software) |
| Project Pulse | Very High | Multiple trademark filings in project mgmt SaaS |
| Nowline | High | AI-powered real-time issue intelligence platform exists |
| Kinetic | Very High | Enterprise software brand (Epicor), plus Kinetic Build Focus productivity app |
| Unstuck | High | Unstuck Task on App Store, Unstuck CBT journaling on Google Play |
| Current | High | Too generic, banking app, SEO nightmare |
| Clarity | High | Dozens of SaaS tools use it |
| NextAction | High | Existing productivity apps, too derivative of GTD |
| Axis | High | Axis cameras, analytics tools, many trademarks |

### User's Top 2 Candidates
1. **Operaxis** — "Operation + Axis" — user's strong frontrunner
   - Tagline: "Intelligent Momentum for Independent Operators"
   - Philosophy: disciplined operating axis that produces momentum
   - "Operator" embedded in name
   - Feels: calm, deliberate, structured, durable, philosophical

2. **Velocient** — "Velocity + Sentience" — strong runner-up
   - More speed-focused, more SaaS energy
   - User acknowledged it's "not quiet" enough

### Other Coined Names Generated (not yet researched)
- Moventis, Axionis, Nexora, Axentra, Operant, Kinetor, Strivon
- ChatGPT second-round "lower-risk": Nownetic, Nownara, Actomuse, Motuvia, Solomotive

### Key Strategic Decision
- Do NOT append "AI" to name
- AI becomes a layer/feature, not the identity
- Movement > product: "Operaxis operators" as identity

## 2. What Still Needs Actual Research

ChatGPT provided risk assessments but could NOT actually:
- Search USPTO trademark database
- Check real domain availability
- Search actual app stores
- Search actual Gumroad listings
- Check actual GitHub repos
- Check actual social media handles

**We need to do actual verification for: Operaxis, Velocient, and 1-2 backup candidates.**
