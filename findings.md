# Findings: 0.6 Product Naming & Branding

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Context:** Section 0.6 of distribution checklist — product naming research

---

## 1. User's Prior Research (ChatGPT Session)

The user already went through extensive naming exploration with ChatGPT. Key decisions:

### Brand Identity
- **Target:** Intelligent independent operators / solopreneurs
- **Feeling:** "Quiet Intelligence"
- **Philosophy:** "A disciplined operating axis that naturally produces momentum"
- **Not selling:** Speed, AI, or task management
- **Selling:** A disciplined operating philosophy

### Eliminated Names (with reasons)
| Name | Risk | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| Momentus | Very High | Momentus Technologies exists (venue/event mgmt software) |
| Project Pulse | Very High | Multiple trademark filings in project mgmt SaaS |
| Nowline | High | AI-powered real-time issue intelligence platform exists |
| Kinetic | Very High | Enterprise software brand (Epicor), plus Kinetic Build Focus productivity app |
| Unstuck | High | Unstuck Task on App Store, Unstuck CBT journaling on Google Play |
| Current | High | Too generic, banking app, SEO nightmare |
| Clarity | High | Dozens of SaaS tools use it |
| NextAction | High | Existing productivity apps, too derivative of GTD |
| Axis | High | Axis cameras, analytics tools, many trademarks |

### User's Top 2 Candidates from ChatGPT
1. **Operaxis** — "Operation + Axis" — user's strong frontrunner
2. **Velocient** — "Velocity + Sentience" — strong runner-up

### Key Strategic Decisions
- Do NOT append "AI" to name
- AI becomes a layer/feature, not the identity
- Tagline: "Intelligent Momentum for Independent Operators"
- Movement > product: community identity matters

## 3. Detailed Findings — Top Candidates

### Conduital — RISK: LOW ✅ (CLEANEST OPTION)
- **Etymology:** Conduit + -al (adjectival). "Of or relating to a conduit" — implies channeling, flow, direction
- **Domain:** conduital.com AVAILABLE ($4.99), conduital.io AVAILABLE, conduital.app AVAILABLE ($19.99)
- **USPTO:** ZERO results — no live or dead filings
- **App Stores:** Clear across Microsoft, Google, Apple
- **GitHub:** github.com/conduital AVAILABLE
- **Twitter/X:** @conduital AVAILABLE
- **Gumroad:** Clear
- **Only existing usage:** Extremely obscure medical adjective in 2-3 surgical papers
- **Verdict:** Complete blank slate. All namespace available. Zero trademark risk.

### Velocient — RISK: MEDIUM ⚠️ (USER'S #2 PICK)
- **Etymology:** Velocity + sentient. Smart acceleration.
- **Domain:** velocient.com TAKEN (GoDaddy, protected, expires 2027); .io/.app likely available
- **USPTO:** Dead trademark (cancelled 2008, un-revivable) — clear to file new
- **Key conflict:** Japanese VBT fitness hardware device (velocient.jp) — different industry
- **Former companies:** Velocient Technologies Inc (US, defunct), Velocient Technologies Ltd (India, struck off), Velocient Technologies Ltd (UK, dissolved 2004)
- **App Stores:** Clear across all
- **GitHub:** Clear
- **Twitter/X:** @velocient likely available
- **Verdict:** Usable but .com unavailable. Dead trademark is favorable. Japanese fitness product is the main concern.

### Moxide — RISK: LOW-MEDIUM ⚠️
- **Etymology:** Momentum + oxide. Suggests chemical energy, catalysis.
- **Domain:** moxide.com FOR SALE (Afternic/GoDaddy, registered 2011); .io/.app likely available
- **USPTO:** None found
- **Key conflict:** Dlurak/moxide — active Rust tmux session manager (15 GitHub stars); music artist on Spotify
- **App Stores:** Clear
- **GitHub org:** github.com/Moxide TAKEN (empty, inactive)
- **Twitter/X:** @moxide TAKEN (dormant since 2010)
- **Verdict:** Decent option but some namespace friction. .com purchasable but at unknown cost.

### Operaxis — RISK: HIGH ❌ (USER'S #1 PICK — BLOCKED)
- **OperAxis LLC** — Active US tech staffing company (Wilmington, DE)
  - 8,140 LinkedIn followers, actively hiring
  - Owns operaxis.com (locked, protected) and operaxis.net (active website)
  - GitHub org taken
  - Common-law trademark rights in tech sector
- **Verdict:** Cannot use. Active US tech company with the exact same name.

## 4. Evaluation Against Criteria

### Scoring Matrix (1-5, higher = better)

| Criterion | Conduital | Velocient | Moxide |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Memorable / easy to spell | 3 | 4 | 4 |
| No confusion with established tools | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| No trademark conflicts | 5 | 4 | 4 |
| Domain available (.com) | 5 | 1 | 2 |
| "Quiet Intelligence" vibe | 3 | 2 | 2 |
| "Operator/movement" alignment | 2 | 3 | 2 |
| Uniqueness/defensibility | 5 | 4 | 4 |
| Pronounceability | 4 | 4 | 5 |
| **TOTAL** | **32** | **27** | **28** |

### Brand Fit Analysis

**Conduital** — Strongest on availability, weakest on brand energy. "Conduit" implies channeling information, connecting things, being a pathway. Could frame as: "Your conduit to productive momentum." Tagline: "The conduit for intelligent momentum." Not as philosophically heavy as Operaxis but clean and ownable.

**Velocient** — Strong brand energy but .com blocked. Fits "intelligent acceleration" but the user said "quiet intelligence, not speed." The dead USPTO trademark is a positive signal for filing your own. Best if user is willing to use .io/.app domain.

**Moxide** — Catchy, short, memorable. But lacks the philosophical depth of Operaxis. More "startup energy" than "movement energy."

## 5. Strategic Recommendation

### The Hard Truth About Operaxis
The user's favorite name is taken by an active US tech company. This is a non-starter for commercial use. The philosophical resonance was real, but the namespace is occupied.

### Recommended Path Forward
Present the user with three viable options, acknowledging that none perfectly replicate Operaxis's philosophical weight:

1. **Conduital** — Cleanest legally, all namespace open, but needs brand energy injection via tagline/positioning
2. **Velocient** — Strongest brand energy, dead trademark favorable, but .com blocked and "speed" vibe conflicts with "quiet intelligence"
3. **Moxide** — Most memorable/catchy, moderate availability, but lacks philosophical depth
